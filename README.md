# WP Engine Geolocation Rediret

Based on [this](https://wpengine.com/support/geotarget/) geolocation service provided by WP Engine. Must have that service enabled for this to work.

Simple script, just grabs both the city and state the user is visiting from, combines the two variables into a City, State format, and redirects if a match is made.
